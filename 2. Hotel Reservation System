Question that can ask to interviewer:

Estimate Calculations::
there are 5000 Hotels and 1 million rooms

Assume 70% of rooms will occupied and average stay will be 3 days

Estimate Daily Reservations = 10^6 * .7 /3 = round 240,000
Reservation per seconds = 240,000/10^5 = round 3. Tps(Transaction Per Second) is not high.

TPS Transactions Per Second is the number of transactions per second. A transaction is a process in which a client sends a request to a server and the server responds. The client starts timing when it sends a request, and ends timing after receiving the server's response, so as to calculate the time used and the number of completed transactions.

QPS Queries Per Second is the query rate per second, which is the corresponding number of queries that a server can perform per second. That is the maximum throughput.

There are 3 Layer: 
View the Hotel/Room list page
View Booking page ---> date, no of reservation, type of roooms
Reserve Room ---> When user clicks confirmation, room is reserved.

Let's assume 10% of the users reach the next steps.
So we found TPS is 3 for reserved room, then QPS is also 3
30 for booking page QPS.
300 for View Hotel/room details
